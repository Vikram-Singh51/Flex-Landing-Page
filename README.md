👉🏻  Applying flex property was amazing.
👉🏻 One problem I face in media query I did not give the height property to left and right id
   so when I applied media query right id was not visible. 
   then I again watch lecture and able to find out the problem😁

👉🏻 Overall project was so simple I did not feel any major
   diffuculty while creating this design.

thankyou for visiting my repo. 
I am despertely waiting for your suggestions. 😉😉😉👨🏼‍💻.
